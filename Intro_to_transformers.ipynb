These were once considered ludicrously large but now we have scaled even beyond a trillion parameters.  This base implementation has become extremely common.

        "On the input side, one of our problems is that when operating on text we cant directly do any math on strings so we need to find some numerical representation for them. In the past people have done work to try to find meaninful vectors that represent each word individually and they build up a massive file represents the whole vocabulary. This is ok but it misses big when a word occurs that has no vector available. Language has a very long tail and it is difficult to cover all possible words and mispelling and random combination of characters and it also doesnt take advantage of the common elements in language like words ending in \"logy\" or words that begin with \"chem\". Many roots have similar meanings and if you operate at the word level it is hard to represent these commonalities. \n",

        "Instead of doing this the language model transformers will operate on tokens instead of words. They will break the words up into chunks. There are a few common options here, byte pair encoding, wordpiece, etc. They all functionally do the same thing though of splitting a word into its constituent pieces. \n",

        "So when we looked at the BERT vocab size of 30522, that doesn't mean it only knows 30522 words, that means it knows that many tokens and that many tokens can recreate basically any combination of characters possible and it will have some understanding. \n",

Possibly there are regular menu items that we missed by coming in an off peak time, but I doubt we will go back to find out.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough we like these kinds of restaurants, especially O Nami in San Diego, this is a poor representation.  The sushi is somewhat fresh, but the fish pieces are too large to eat in one bite and the rice quite small, it was an awkward eating experience.  I particularly dislike combo sushis without any labeling and there was none here.  There are also some hot dishes, such as soups, stir fries, fried noodles, and tempura shrimp and vegetables.  These were not bad, but not worth recommending.  The one thing that probably keeps people coming back is the chocolate fountain, which we are not particularly fond of.  The rest of the desserts are forgettable.\\\\n\\\\nBut the one thing that will definitely keep me away was the MSG headache I got less than hour after eating there.  It\\'s been years since I had to worry about this food additive.  Although my headache was not bad, I don\\'t need this experience again.  Go only if MSG doesn\\'t bother you.'"
